## Summary



## Learning-Points

As this was the first time working as a team, most of ou key learning points related to how to co-exist in a team.  Our strengths included:
- Communicating changes to code, and working together to ensure updates get into the code
- Setting reasonable expectations for goals
- Pivoting quickly with good pacing of development/programming worknot losing time
- Distribution of work / Willingness to pair program and assist when teammates are stuck

With regards to the technology learning points, we put into practice our ability to research and implement data from RapidAPI and the TrailRunProject Data API, and using Google Maps to help represent some of this returned data.  This was also a learning experience for each of our team in the practical application of Passport.js to control authentication and access to secure areas of our application.
