## Summary



## Learning-Points

This project provided a chance to refine my ability to develop routes linking server-side data with client-side activity.  It also allowed for a chance to explore more of what is possible with MongoDB and Mongoose, and work with a Non-relational database, where my previous professional experience (and class experience) included exposure to SQL/relational databases.
